Excellent service,0
"This is the worst app I ever used, I was in an online class and I immediately needed some extra GB. But nothing works in this app when I chose the amount of GB. Also, when I tried to sign out from this app I could not sign out. What I don't understand is that despite being an organization which works with technology, they cannot make a proper app. I am completely disappointed.",1
useless app.,1
The worst app u can find in the store.,0
Very useful app.Thank you Telecom.,0
Not loading the data usage giving me a error tried log out and log in also tried clearing data and cache and log in but still have the error,1
History tab doesn't work...,1
bill එක online pay කරන option එක active කරානම් ගොඩක් වටිනව,0
"Giving this app 4 stars because even though other aspects of the app is on point it has a major flaw and that is this app does not automatically update my SLTfiber data usage real time insted it update todays data usage as tomorrow's data usage and that is confusing and hard to track, if SLT needs to be transparent and a reliable app they need to give that information real time.",0
"Though it is generally ok, it gets stuck frequently.",1
I love SLT ❤❤,0
"App is not that bad. However, the quality of the customer service of SLT is extremely poor overall. I am using SLT because I don't have any other choice at the moment.",0
Most of the time it says service unavailable!,1
"Worst app ever ! Getting unavailable service all the time and Application keeps getting stuck, i would encourage you to work on your mobile app next time rather than giving 'shakaboom' packages.",1
When i add extra data it finishers in no time. I am confused my usage is 1gb or less for a day I added 10gb on 17th August . 22nd my balance is only 1gb. How come this happen?🙄 They are faking with our money. And worest is non of their apps works properly and does not provide information we need to check. We need to see our day and night balance seperately and extra gb usage seperately. Worse service ever....😡,0
My Slt app is not working in samsung android phone. Installed several times but same.,1
"What was wrong with the previous SLT Selfcare app? The UI is still convoluted and messy, the color choice is dank and it does not match with the nice blue colored bootup splash screen. I stumbled up here since I saw an error saying ""Service Currently Unavailavle"" but the web version is working like a charm as if nothing has happened.",1
"Worst service from slt, they will never attend your complaints",0
This app has some problems.. Need a quick development!!!!!,0
I am unable to login even after entering all required credential. Not the best of experiences,0
"Ui/Ux: 1/5, System Working: 1/5, Just showing ""severice is unavailable"" So what is the purpose of this app? 💁",1
"It's disappointing, always not working properly",1
"I've been trying to log into my account. But it showed ""Sorry for the inconvenience caused. Service will be available soon."" 🙂 I contacted the SLT hotline after waiting for almost 16 minutes. But they couldn't fix that problem either. Disappointed. 👎 Please give the old app back. 😅",1
User interface is horrible sometimes it bugs when i purchase extra GB. Needed to be upgraded!,0
It is easy to control the data,0
"Not worth even a single star. The signal connection is terrible, and the customer service is poor. They know they have a poor connection and that customers are facing issues, but they act like there's no problem. We're paying, but the data gets used up quickly without proper coverage. SLT is turning out to be just as bad as Lanka Bell. The coordinators and staff at Aluthmawatha are very lazy. They don’t provide any solutions and just tell us to go to the head office because they themselves do",1
🚨 History Tab (Previous package buying detals by date) not working. Fix that as soon as possible.,1
"No customer satisfaction. Those options, functions are not working properly.",1

Very excellent,0
"I was using this app. My bill is also linked to it. However, my details were automatically deleted and then I tried to enter my telephone number, account number and my ID. But i got an error message saying my ID is wrong...",1
Why can't you guys show the usage simply in MB or GB instead of the percentage. One more thing this app only shows me the usage of the day bundle and the usage of the whole bundle. It is confusing. If you guys issue data as day and night bundles why don't you show the usage like that...,1
After update app suddenly closed. Tried to completely uninstalled and reinstalled but problem still persit.,1
Very bad app.,0
Good.Pinchiya and beautiful tanniya,0
Kaspersky products section (value-added services) is not working not only in the MySLT app but also in the MySLT web page. Please fix it!,1
"Excellent App. Super easy loged with my Google account. Give information TP number, billing account number and NIC to add an account. Long waiting functions from SLT. Can see service status. Bill Payment status and pay the bill. Can logde faults. Can made service upgrade, new connection. Can subscribe to e-bill service.",0

Worst app ever used,0
Terrible app. When I open the app always it always say Service Temporary Unavailable. Can't get any services from the app. As a leading telecommunication company in the country SLT should ashamed their self about this app.,1
"Unprofessional, crazy and unpractical App. When registration started always say invalid username and invalid password. But unfortunately still SLT is sleeping without rectifying the App. Please do not insult your valuable customers since you are survive form them. Clearly shows careless and unconcern attention.😡😡😡",0
Very bad and useless app....can't even log into it....do not even install it...it is a wastage of your data,1
Very bad cannot log in,1
"Basically, yes it does the job. But the User interface is awful and is very frustrating to use. The animations are choppy when switching from windows and applying commands. But where it needs the most improvements is the organisation of buttons, its all over the place and is not catogarised. For example; why is there a whole separate section for Complaints, it's not something that users will use all the time (could have been in a sub menu and the section replaced with something more important.)",0
This is sucks,0
"Although the app is really useful, user experience is awful. Full of bugs, system doesn't work when you need it. Very slow.",1
"First of all, you have to sort out why gating crash and very slow. I am using myslt out of SL.",1

"Not working properly ,Always shows an error prompt when opened ( p.s.- Now there is no such an error , still there is room to improve, but overall it's usable)",1
"They market themselves like they are the only one best ISP in the country. But they can't even maintain their own app. If I open the app 10 times per a day- 8 times actually it is broken. Says service is temporary unavailable or some sh**. These days they are giving an Christmas offer with free 50gb social media package for 14days. Even it's free, I can't use it because my main package data is reached out the limit. I mean what's there in free?? Why they've became this cheap?",1
I just paid the November month bill thru this app and ended up getting freezed but the amount for deducted from the bank account. The app is really useless garbage since app getting freeze during payment is horrible. I need an immediate solution.,1
Service is too late. There are dropouts thrice in a month. Takes 3 or 4 days to get connection,0

"One of the worst experiences ever. Use of an app should make life easier and it should act as the medium that keeps a consumer from needing to physically attend to get something done. Authentication failed, user interface is trash. I think I am going to switch to Dialog. Worst experience ever, I hope the company fails.",0

Please add a conformation function to package upgrades section. I accidentally tapped on a upgrade button while browsing the package details and the request was sent without even asking for a conformation for the action. And my package was automatically updated and now I have to wait until the end of the month to degrade it. And also I have to pay the bill according to the new package. What if I accidentally tapped on a big package with a hefty price? Add conformation promts to functions.,0
Good service but automated deduction is the unnecessary system,0
"Not working as expected. I have only added my broadband account and it doesn't even show the account details. Instead it gives an error message saying ""Sorry! Account details not available"". On the other hand why do you have two different self-care apps..? Merge both MySLT app and SLT Selfcare app. If I want to upgrade my broadband package that also not working. I can't see any options to do so. Stop releasing buggy apps.",1
